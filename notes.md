# Difference between WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY in SQL

In SQL, the clauses `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` are used for processing and organizing data, each serving a distinct purpose:

### 1. WHERE Clause
**Purpose:** The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records, ensuring that only those meeting specific criteria are selected or affected.

**When to Use:** Use the `WHERE` clause when you need to select or manipulate rows in a database that satisfy certain conditions.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Select all employees who are older than 30 years
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Age > 30;
```

### 2. ORDER BY Clause
**Purpose:** The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the data in the result set.

**When to Use:** Use this clause when you need to sort the results by one or more columns.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Sort employees by age in ascending order
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY Age ASC;
```

### 3. GROUP BY Clause
**Purpose:** The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group multiple records in the result set into groups. It is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions (like `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.) to perform a statistical operation on each group.

**When to Use:** Use the `GROUP BY` clause when you need to group data by one or several columns and perform statistical calculations on each group.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Count the number of employees in each department
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

### Combining Clauses
These clauses can be combined to construct complex queries. For example, you might want to query all employees over the age of 30 in a particular department and sort the results by age in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales' AND Age > 30
ORDER BY Age ASC;
```

Alternatively, you might want to count the number of employees over the age of 30 in each department:

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
WHERE Age > 30
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY NumberOfEmployees DESC;
```

Here, we used the `WHERE` clause to filter employees, the `GROUP BY` to group employees by department for counting, and `ORDER BY` to sort the departments by the number of employees. This demonstrates how to combine these clauses to execute more complex data queries and analyses.

# Difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL

In SQL, both `UNION` and `UNION ALL` are operators used to combine the results of two or more queries, but they differ in how they handle duplicate records in the result sets:

### 1. UNION
**Purpose:** The `UNION` operator combines the results of two or more queries into a single result set while automatically removing duplicate rows. `UNION` by default performs a deduplication operation, meaning that even if multiple queries result in the same records, these records will only appear once in the final result set.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Suppose there are two queries, one returning the names of all engineers and another returning the names of all salespeople
SELECT name FROM Engineers
UNION
SELECT name FROM Sales;
```
In the example above, if a person is both an engineer and a salesperson, their name will appear only once in the result set.

### 2. UNION ALL
**Purpose:** The `UNION ALL` operator also combines the results of two or more queries, but it does not remove duplicate rows from the results. When using `UNION ALL`, all records are included in the final result set, even if this means duplicates will appear.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Again, returning the names of all engineers and all salespeople
SELECT name FROM Engineers
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM Sales;
```
In this example, if the same person's name appears in both tables, that name will appear twice in the final result set.

### Conclusion
Whether to use `UNION` or `UNION ALL` depends on whether you need to retain duplicate records in the final results. If you need to keep all records from the queries, including duplicates, then you should use `UNION ALL`. If you need to remove duplicates to ensure each record appears only once in the result set, then you should use `UNION`.

`UNION ALL` is generally faster than `UNION` because it omits the deduplication step. When dealing with large datasets, choosing `UNION ALL` appropriately can significantly enhance query performance.


# Why Use `UPPER` and `LIKE` in SQL, and the Significance of `'A%'` with Single Quotes and Percent Sign

- **Using the `UPPER` Function:**
  - The `UPPER` function is used to convert text to uppercase. This is particularly useful in SQL queries when performing case-insensitive matching. By converting both the data in the database and the matching condition to uppercase (or lowercase), it ensures consistent comparison, thereby avoiding mismatches due to case differences.

- **Using the `LIKE` Statement:**
  - `LIKE` is an operator in SQL used for pattern matching within `WHERE` clauses. It is typically used with wildcards to search for data that fits a specific pattern.

- **The Role of Single Quotes and Percent Sign in `'A%'`:**
  - **Single Quotes:** In SQL, text strings must be enclosed in single quotes. This is part of the syntax used to clearly indicate that the content is character data.
  - **Percent Sign `%`:** This is a wildcard used in `LIKE` statements. The percent sign represents any sequence of characters, including none. When you query with `'A%'`, it means to find all data starting with the letter "A". The characters that follow can be anything and of any length.

### Example Query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'A%' 
   OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'E%' 
   OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'I%' 
   OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'O%' 
   OR UPPER(CITY) LIKE 'U%';
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `UPPER(CITY)`: Converts all letters of the `CITY` field to uppercase.
  - `LIKE 'A%'`: Matches all city names that start with the uppercase letter "A". Since `CITY` has been converted to uppercase, this includes city names that originally start with lowercase "a".

This approach ensures that all city names starting with a vowel are retrieved, regardless of how they are stored in the database (uppercase or lowercase), enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the query.
